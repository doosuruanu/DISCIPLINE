<h1>DISCIPLINE</h1>
 <p>Discipline is described as adhering to or obeying a set of rules. Our lives become more organised when we follow those rules. Working as per the rules is a lot of fun and makes everything normal and straightforward. That's why there is a determined effort to maintain discipline in institutions like schools.</p>
